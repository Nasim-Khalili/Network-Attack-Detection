# Network Attack Detection

## Description

This project focuses on detecting network attacks using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to analyze network traffic data and identify malicious activities based on predefined attack patterns.

## Features

- Real-time network traffic monitoring
- Detection of common network attacks (e.g., DDoS, Man-in-the-Middle, SQL Injection)
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Visualization of attack patterns
- Logging and alerting mechanism

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (Choose based on model implementation)
- Pandas & NumPy for data processing
- Wireshark / Scapy for network packet analysis
- Flask / FastAPI for API integration
- SQL / NoSQL Database for storing logs

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-attack-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd network-attack-detection
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- Run the system and monitor real-time network traffic.
- Adjust detection thresholds in the configuration file.
- Analyze logs and detected attack reports.

## Dataset

- The system can use publicly available datasets like **CICIDS 2017**, **NSL-KDD**, or custom network traffic data.

## Future Improvements

- Integration with cloud-based security monitoring tools
- Enhanced deep learning models for better accuracy
- Deployment as a scalable web service
